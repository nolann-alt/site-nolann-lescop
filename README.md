# Old Portfolio Website

This project is my first personal portfolio website.  
It was created to present my projects, skills, and background.  
It represents my early experience in front-end development and served as the basis for my current, more advanced portfolio.

## About the project

This website was my first complete web project.  
It allowed me to learn the fundamentals of front-end development and to apply what I learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal was to create a simple and responsive (I tryed) portfolio to present myself and my first projects.

## Lessons learned

By making this project, I learned how to:

- Use CSS for layout and responsive design  
- Add interactivity with JavaScript and GSAP
